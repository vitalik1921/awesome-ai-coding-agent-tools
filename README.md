This list collects the **tools, libraries, MCP servers, and frameworks that power AI coding agents** — from the skills and plugins that extend them, to the SDKs you'd build them with, to the supporting layers (memory, sandboxing, evals, observability, benchmarks) that turn demos into production. The agents themselves (Claude Code, Cursor, aider, Cline, …) live in their own repos; this list is the ecosystem around them. Inclusion is based on visible community use rather than star counts. Every entry includes nested **Strengths** and **Caveats** bullets so you can compare at a glance.
